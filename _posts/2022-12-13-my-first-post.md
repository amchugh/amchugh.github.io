# The Beginning

Writing the first of something is hard! Writer's block is a [well documented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block) condition. I am lucky. This first post is going to write itself (for the most part)!

I will ~begin~ launch into this project with a _short_ test of some of the styling decorators in Jekyll while talking about the dreams for the project!

Hmm. The `~begin~` didn't do the crossed-out effect I wanted. Guess I don't have that style without some extra work. Maybe one day it will?

# The Project

My goals for this project are two-fold, in order:
1. Create a fun, co-op game that my girlfriend will play with me
2. Document my experiences so that I can look back on these moments in a few years

I aim to write one of these blog posts every week or so, and at least once a month. Progress will be slow as I'm in school and that sucks down a tremendous amount of my time.

## What is the game exactly?

Look up Dig Dug, Motherload, TowerFall, and SteamWorld Dig 2 and you should have a pretty good idea of what I'm going for. I learned about [Super Motherload](https://store.steampowered.com/app/269110/Super_Motherload/) yesterday and that also seems close to what I want, although I haven't played it. 

Other big inspirations are Helldivers, Subset Games, Suspicious Developments (Tom Francis), and Joe Kucan. Not that these are related to the game I'm envisioning right now, but they're cool people/games and deserve more attention.

## The Blog

I'm using a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) template named [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).
I'm having a good time using it. It is very well designed. When I first saw it, I got a little overwhelmed by how much *stuff* there is to it and almost chose a far simpler theme, but my girlfriend swayed me into picking this template instead. I'm glad she did. Shoutout `cotes2020`; this is awesome.

## Seriously? The Game!? You didn't say anything!

I don't have the energy to write out my ideas for the game right now, nor do I have the energy to begin development. Instead, I will leave you with this image as I figure out how to get Jekyll to work and go study:
