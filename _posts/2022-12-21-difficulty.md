# Difficulty, Percieved Difficulty, and Setting Good Expectations

I was talking with my girlfriend about what kind of game she would like to play. We were talking mostly about motherlode and the difficulty in that game. Motherlode is quite an unforgiving game. 
When you die, you have to restart from the beginning. 

This was surprising to me. She doesn't like hard or punishing games; she really likes Animal Crossing and Pokemon, both games where death either doesn't exist or isn't hugely problematic. They're also both not too difficult.

I don't want to make a peaceful game. I want to make a game with conflict and challenge, but I still want her to enjoy it! So I asked her why does she like Motherlode so much, even though it is hard and punishing?

From our conversation, I took away three major points.

1. The final boss fight is scary and she purposefully avoided it.
2. The game feels fair; death is avoidable with skill.
3. The beginning is stressful but in a way that encourages improvement

Let's tackle these one-by-one:

## Conflict

I want to put some challenge in my game in the form of enemies who would like to see you fail. 
This could be percieved as stressful in two ways:
1. The game wants you to fail
2. The enemies in the game want you to fail

My hypothesis is that, if the first one is true, the game will be percieved as unfair and therefore my girlfriend will find it not fun.

For evidence, I'm reminded of Mario and a clone called [Unfair Mario](https://www.unfair-mario.com/). If you haven't tried Unfair Mario, go give it a shot for 5 minutes using the link and come back so you can better understand what I'm about to say. Everyone has played Mario.

In Mario, your main opposition is the enemies. At no point do you feel like the game or the mechanics of the game are to blame, it's always "Those pesky goombas" or "wow, how does Bowser live in this airship?! This is one giant OSHA violation!".
From my perspective, the enemies are to blame for the challenge in the game.

This contrasts with the difficulty in Unfair Mario. In Unfair Mario, I didn't even see a single enemy! We are fighting the creator of the game. And, while I like the concept, this is not the kind of game I want to make here. Even the movement is upsetting as Mario tends to slide around on the ground more than I want him to. 

In Mario, it's you vs Bowser and his army. In Unfair Mario, it's you vs the game's creator. 
I should be cognizant of this as I'm designing my game.

> _But Aidan, what does this have to do with your girlfriend's fear of the final boss battle?_

Well, ironically, I think Motherlode is more of the second kind of game; I think it's more like Unfair Mario. The game's challenge, in the beginning, is against the environment. You can quickly run out of gas or health and this results in an instant gameover. 
The fact that Motherlode transitions between the two so quickly is scary.

I think the creator of Motherlode could have built up to this boss fight. As opposed to it having only the ultimate battle, if there were other enemies that would empower the player. I think because there's no build-up, the fear of the unknown is stressful.

This brings us nicely into our next bullet point

## Fairness

It's a bit of a meme, the whole 'git gud' thing, but I think there is some merit to it. Take Elden Ring, an infamously difficult game. It is unforgiving, brutally challenging game where the player frequently dies over and over to the same enemy, where skeletons pop out from behind corners and push your character off cliffs. 
Yet, [Elden Ring](https://screenrant.com/elden-ring-game-year-2022-god-war-ragnarok/) won game of the year in 2022. This wasn't a surprise. It's [regarded as a good game](https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review). 

I think part of this is because it lets the player 'get good'. It has a high skill cieling; a better player is clearly distinguishable from a worse player, and you can improve at the game simply by playing it. 

I think Motherlode is similar, and I think that's part of why Alma[^gf] likes it. She's far better at the game than I am. Simply by playing the game you get more familiar with the fuel timer, with how the jetpack handles. The feeling of becoming better at the game is rewarding.

## Stress

A big source of stress for me in games is having to do the same thing over and over again because I think it's the right thing to do, even if it's not fun. I understand that may be confusing so let me elaborate.

In Halo Infinite, there is this one mini-boss with an energy sword who will kill you in one hit unless you have full health and full shield. 

## The Takeaway
