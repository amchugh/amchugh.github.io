# What's Up?

It has been a while since I last wrote a blog post. I'm writing this as a checkpoint.

## Work Updates

I finished college in 3 years. I did not like RPI. I had to get out of there. I'm now working at Amazon in Austin, Texas (more on that in a minute). I work on a team named Navigation Intelligence. We strive to give the best navigation instructions to our transporters given the paths from one place to the next. I really like my coworkers.

## Personal Life

Went through a bad breakup with that girlfriend. My AI assistant recommended the following line "I'm still healing from it". Ironically, I healed from that breakup and am now healing from the one after. Sucks.

Austin is fantastic. I love it here. The weather is really nice. It's enabled me to start playing sand volleyball near my apartment. It's been a blast. I've also been doing a lot of rock climbing. Pretty terrible at it, but I've met some cool people doing it.

This is my short update. Maybe I'll do a longer one soon. Who knows. God?
